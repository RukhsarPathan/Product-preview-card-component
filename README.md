# Frontend Mentor - Product Preview Card Component

This was a wonderful project where I got to apply multiple core frontend skills in one small but well-rounded challenge.

## 🛠 Built With

- HTML5
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- `<picture>` tag for responsive images
- VS Code

## 📱 Responsive Design

This project is fully responsive for both mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) screen sizes. I used media queries to swap out image layouts and restructure the card for smaller viewports.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to structure a component with Flexbox
- Using the `<picture>` element with `media` and `srcset` to swap images based on screen width
- Creating responsive layouts with media queries
- Managing conditional text formatting with `.heading-desktop` and `.heading-mobile` using `display: none` and `display: block`
- Improving layout spacing and alignment through trial-and-error and helpful suggestions from ChatGPT

## 🧠 Personal Notes

This was my first time implementing media queries entirely on my own. When I ran into a layout issue where all `h1` and `p` elements showed twice, I learned how to control them using mobile/desktop-specific classes and conditional CSS. It was such a great “aha!” moment and I even reused the technique for other elements with unique formatting on different screens.

This project looked small, but it included a bit of everything: Flexbox, hover effects, responsive images, text styling, and semantic HTML.
